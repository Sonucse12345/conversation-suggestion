Boy:  Its been a while since we last talked. 
Girl:  It has, but why? 
Boy:  Are you in love again? 
Girl:  No, I havent. I dont want to. 
Boy:  I get it, but why havent you? 
Girl:  Its just hard. I just wish 
Boy:  I wish that too. 
Girl:  Its been so long. 
Boy:  We dont have to lose time anymore. 
Girl:  Im afraid, what if we dont. 
Boy:  What if we do? 
Girl:  What can we do then? 
Boy:  We have to be patient, things are becoming. 
Girl:  Things are becoming true again. 
Boy:  I didnt wish that to happen, Im sorry. 
Girl:  Im sorry too. I planned my life to be with you, not without you and things seemed to be shattered. 
Boy:  My heart is shattered, but I havent lost hope on us, I never stopped. 
Girl:  Id never stopped either. I think of you every once in a while, I think if you where could we be right now, if you were the one for me. If we were meant to be. 
Boy:  Its really hard seeing you not by my side, like we swear we would, and we both know Im, we both know we are. 
Girl:  Now will never know. 
Boy:  We know, but. 
Girl:  But 
Boy:  But what if we know, why we dont. 
Girl:  Because I believe its too complicated, but we can. Just not right now. 
Boy:  Ill wait for you if you tell me to. 
Girl:  Time can be the only that can tell if we get our chance. 
Boy:  Are you asking me to wait? 
Girl:  Im, are you going to? 
Boy:  Im. 
Girl:  Im happy but I dont know if things are going to be like I think, like I dream them to be. Im scared to lose you, to lose us again. 
Boy:  I promise things are going to be like you once dreamed them to be, I just wish to be in your dreams. 
Girl:  You know you are in my dreams. 
Boy:  Please can you look me in the eyes. 
Girl:  Please say something. 
Boy:  I love you. 
Girl:  I love you too. 
Boy:  Please dont be afraid Ill protect you, Ill make you happy, and we got a lifetime ahead just for you and me. 
Girl:  I really really love you. 
Boy:  I really love you too. 
Girl:  I need you to be sincere and honest. Dont ever leave me again please. 
Boy:  Babe, I never left you, Ive kept you in my heart since the day I first held your hand. 
Girl:  I remember that day like if it was today. It felt really amazing, I couldnt say a word. I couldnt take my eyes from yours. 
Boy:  It was really special for me, I fell in love in that second. I couldnt say a word either, didnt want to, because I was afraid of ruining our moment. 
Girl:  Are those moments coming back? 
Boy:  I hope someday they do. 
Girl:  Me too. 
Boy:  What do you want in life? 
Girl:  Nobody had ever asked me that before. 
Boy:  Do you have an idea? 
Girl:  I just want to be happy. 
Boy:  What will your happiness be made of? Am I included? 
Girl:  I wish all of my dreams come true to be happy like in the fairytales. 
Boy:  I can be your guardian angel, making you feel safe. 
Girl:  I would really like that. 
Boy:  I always saw you like no one ever had. 
Girl:  Thats true. The way you see into my heart and soul, the way you know my emotions. Only you have that power over me. 
Boy:  Really? 
Girl:  I wouldnt lie to you about this. I never had done it before. 
Boy:  I know you wouldnt, you are sacred for me. You mean the world to me. 
Girl:  You mean everything to me, and if we get our chance I hope it can last forever. 
Boy:  I promise it will. I wont be the same... Im going to do everything for you, whatever it takes to make you happy, thats what my heart tells me to do. 
Girl:  I. 
Boy:  You dont have to say something its okay. 
Girl:  Thank you. 
Boy:  Dont say thank you, I mean it. This is from my heart. I meant every single word I say to you. 
Girl:  This feels like in the movies. 
Boy:  So true so real. Is this pure? 
Girl:  This is more than pure. 
Boy:  Nothing is going to get between us. 
Girl:  How do you know? 
Boy:  I can see it in your eyes I can feel it in my heart. 
Girl:  I feel it too. This is real. 
Boy:  Ill put you first ahead of everything, Ill put us first ahead of everything. 
Girl:  You dont have to promise everything. 
Boy:  Okaywhen we get our chance if we do, I promise my words are going to get to action. Ill do as I say Im going to. 
Girl:  I wish that we never be separate ever again. 
Boy:  Please dont ever go. 
Girl:  Please dont let me go. Please dont ever let me go. 
Boy:  I wont, I wont. 
Girl:  Can I tell you something? 
Boy:  Yes please. 
Girl:  Im afraid sometimes of getting my heart broken again. 
Boy:  It is really my fault. Im truly sorry. Im going to make this up to you someday if you let me. 
Girl:  I gave you my heart. What happened? 
Boy:  I got lost. 
Girl:  How could you do this to me? 
Boy:  (silence). 
Girl:  Why if you love me so much, why did you break my heart? 
Boy:  I wont make any excuses. I got lost, I did it all wrong. 
Girl:  (still crying) Im really in love with you. 
Boy:  Let me hold you, please. 
Girl:  (didnt say anything). 
Boy:  (holding her) I was just a boy. Id never stopped loving you since the day I met you. Id suffered since the day you left me. My heart got broken too, but I was too blind to see what I was doing to you. I was hurting you, and Im sorry for that. I love you with all my heart, because of you Im a better man, for you I wanted to be better so that maybe, just maybe, you could give us another chance. 
Girl:  I know. I know you are being really sincere and honest with me. 
Boy:  Im. 
Girl:  (calming down) Im better because of you too. 
Boy:  You make me see life from a different perspective. I found love in you. 
Girl:  I found it in you. 
Boy:  You still are the greatest thing that has happened in my life. 
Girl:  (kept silence). 
Boy:  You really are. 
Girl:  Are you in love with me? 
Boy:  Im deeply in love with you. 
Girl:  But why? I know Im not perfect and that I have a lot of things that we argue about. 
Boy:  Love is not easy. Its special, its happiness, sadness, its kind, joy, its sincere, you can feel a lot of emotions getting together when we are in love. I feel all of those emotions and more when Im with you. 
Girl:  Thats really sweet. 
Boy:  I mean it. 
Girl:  I feel all those things for you, that is why Im so in love with you. Im really happy by your side. 
Boy:  You make me feel complete again. It feels really nice. 
Girl:  Im only complete with you. This time we were not together has been the toughest days ever. 
Boy:  My days were endless and all I wanted is to sleep so that I couldnt think of you, but still sleeping you were on my mind. Every dream was of you. 
Girl:  Is that bad? I thought that was okay. 
Boy:  It is okay, but I know you were not with me, and knowing that you were not with me those thoughts really killed me. Those times when I wondered where you were, with whom, if you were happy or not, that made me feel worst. 
Girl:  Ive felt exactly the same. Im just afraid of telling you all this without knowing what you felt. 
Boy:  Dont be afraid, please, you are the only one who knows who I really am. 
Girl:  I feel you know me too, like no other human had. 
Boy:  You make me feel really special. 
Girl:  You make me feel like if we have hope again. 
Boy:  I never stopped wishing to be with you. 
Girl:  I just wanted all of this loneliness to go away. I was too afraid. 
Boy:  I know it took me a long time to let you know I still love you. 
Girl:  Im glad you did. It doesnt matter how long you took. 
Boy:  You are correct. What matters is that we were able to talk about this. 
Girl:  Thats right. 
Boy:  If we can only be together right now, it would make me happier. 
Girl:  There is no need to rush things. Im not going anywhere without you, never again. 
Boy:  This is gravity pulling us together again. 
Girl:  This is our destiny, for us to be together. Thats what my life isus, you and me forever. It doesnt matter how hard this can be, I want to be with you. 
Boy:  I see my future with you I see my life with you. I never thought a lifetime without you. 
Girl:  But we are together now, lets take our time. 
Boy:  Im never letting you go and if you go away someday Ill go with you. I love you. 
Girl:  I love you too. 
Boy:  Do you promise to be with me? 
Girl:  I promise. Im giving us a second chance. 
Boy:  Youll be happier than before. 
Girl:  Id never felt this for someone. You make me feel so alive, so brave, so in love. 
Boy:  Ill keep you safe Ill be everything and more for you. 
Girl:  You already are. 
Boy:  This is a new beginning, I waited for this so long. 
Girl:  It is really happening, you and me all over again. Suddenly my fears are not getting in our way. 
Boy:  Are you sure about this? We can wait if you want to. 
Girl:  Im sure I want you in my life. I dont want to waste more time being without you. 
Boy:  Well, Im here now for you. Ill be here forever. 
Girl:  Im here too. 
Boy:  (approaching a bit toward her) 
Girl:  (approaching a bit toward him) 
Boy:  (Looking at her eyes) 
Girl:  (Looking at his eyes) 
Boy:  May I kiss you? 
Girl:  You may. 
Boy:  All of this time we felt the same things. 
Girl:  Were you afraid too? 
Boy:  I was afraid of getting rejected by you. 
Girl:  You felt vulnerable, right? 
Boy:  I did. I didnt know how to deal with that. 
Girl:  So you got scared. 
Boy:  (looking nervous) Yes. 
Girl:  I never thought you were afraid too. 
Boy:  I was, but Im not anymore. Ive realized that by your side I have nothing to fear. 
Girl:  When we are together there is nothing that I fear only the thought of us not being together scares me a lot. 
Boy:  I dont want you to leave. 
Girl:  I wont, I dont want to leave. 
Boy:  We can definitely work this through if we want to. 
Girl:  I know we can, I think we need this. 
Boy:  I feel like if we were never separated. 
Girl:  I feel the same way. 
Boy:  Is there something I need to know? 
Girl:  You were always on my mind. 
Boy:  I like that. 
Girl:  There is no day I stop thinking about you. 
Boy:  We are still in your heart? 
Girl:  We are. 
Boy:  Never say never. Not with us. 
Girl:  We can say forever. 
Boy:  Forever? 
Girl:  Yes, forever. Why do you ask? 
Boy:  Because I have been waiting a long time to hear those words from you. 
Girl:  Oh well we are going to. 
Boy:  I wont sleep tonight thinking of today, about us, hoping that our lives that we can be together. 
Girl:  You are really sweet. 
Boy:  You are sweet with me. 
Girl:  I think our chance is getting closer and closer. 
Boy:  I cant wait. 
Girl:  Me neither. 
Boy:  Do you think we are going to get married? 
Girl:  I hope one day we will. Until that day Im going to keep dreaming and wishing. 
Boy:  You are the queen of my heart. 
Girl:  (Blushing) Thank you, my prince charming. 
Boy:  So what happens next? 
Girl:  We are going to see each other a lot more. 
Boy:  I hope this is for our best. 
Girl:  I love you. There is no other man for me like you. 
Boy:  (Blushing) Thank you. You are really special for me too. 
Girl:  You mean everything to me. 
Boy:  You mean everything to me too. Im lost without you, please stay with me. 
Girl:  Im all yours. I was always yours. 
Boy:  I need you so much in my life. 
Girl:  You are still the one. 
Boy:  You are the one I see in my dreams sharing my life with. 
Girl:  Why did we take so long to talk again? I dont regret it. I just wish this happened before. 
Boy:  Oh before I forget I brought you some chocolates. 
Girl:  Thats very kind of you, thank you. 
Boy:  Youre welcome, go ahead open them. 
Girl:  You can still surprise me that still amaze me. 
Boy:  I try my best to keep you surprised not to do the same things all over again. 
Girl:  Youre doing a great job then. 
Boy:  The grace that you have makes me fall in love with you more and more. 
Girl:  I do? 
Boy:  You are always so careful, so kind and lovely with me it really makes me fall for you. 
Girl:  You never told me that before. 
Boy:  I have, maybe you never realize that before until now. 
Girl:  (Crying) Babies? 
Boy:  Yes, babies. I want to have babies with you someday. And will name it after you if our baby is a girl. 
Girl:  (Still Crying) We are going to name it after you if it is a boy. 
Boy:  (Kissing her forehead) I dont want to live my life without you anymore. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, no more excuses or time to think. I dont want to think anymore, I just want to be with you, my love. 
Girl:  (Looking deeply at him) Is this true? 
Boy:  This is true, this is our fate. 
Girl:  You and me. 
Boy:  You and me, this time its going to be better, no one will get between us. 
Girl:  No one will. 
Boy:  I love you with all my heart, my babe. 
Girl:  Im really happy. My heart is pumping so fast, I feel such a rush of blood through my head. Im in love. 
Boy:  Mine too, its really exciting, us. I cant think clearly. But that wont stop me from loving you. 
Girl:  (Laughing) Dont worry, my dear. 
Boy:  I would like to kiss you. May I? 
Girl:  I would really love to kiss you too, and yes, my dear, you may. Boy and 
Girl:  (Kissing slowly). 
Boy:  I love you, my love. 
Girl:  I love you too, my dear. 
Boy:  We came a long way... Right? 
Girl:  Im sure we have, my dear. Did you love someone else? 
Boy:  I liked someone but I never loved. 
Girl:  All of this time I knew, but I knew you wanted me too. 
Boy:  I panicked when you left me. 
Girl:  So did I. 
Boy:  Why, did you like someone else? 
Girl:  No. Why did you like her? 
Boy:  I was trying to forget you, instead I loved you more. 
Girl:  Why were you trying to forget me? 
Boy:  I never lost my hope, but I was suffering so much. I thought that was maybe my way out. 
Girl:  But it wasnt. 
Boy:  No, it was not. 
Girl:  You didnt have to be afraid of loving me. 
Boy:  I know I didnt. 
Girl:  Okay. 
Boy:  But. you never answer my calls. 
Girl:  I was just upset with you. I never stopped loving you. 
Boy:  Oh my. 
Girl:  You are my true love. 
Boy:  As you are mine. 
Girl:  After a while, I knew that again. But I didnt know what to do. 
Boy:  You needed to say three words to make this all better. 
Girl:  One thing I love about you is that with you I felt safe. Everything was great. With you, I learned to trust myself, to believe in myself. 
Boy:  What I love from you, you believed in me when no one else did. You are everything. 
Girl:  A lot of things were mistaken but never us. 
Boy:  We were our only trust, our hope, our faith, we were our love, and we were just you and me. 
Girl:  We were everything. 
Boy:  For once, things were right, things felt right. 
Girl:  We were the greatest couple ever. 
Boy:  Are we going to hide our love? 
Girl:  I dont want to hide us, not anymore. 
Boy:  So dont. 
Girl:  You are very patient with me. 
Boy:  Because I love you, you are worth waiting for. 
Girl:  You are worth too. 
Boy:  Dont worry, together we can achieve whatever we want. Most importantly, we can make us again. 
Girl:  You give me hope and faith with your words. You give me something to believe in. Something worth taking a risk. You give me a reason to live. Thats what we are. 
Boy:  You gave your heart. 
Girl:  Where were you? 
Boy:  Ive been watching you, Ive been here. 
Girl:  We are going on the same path again. 
Boy:  Are you going to leave me? 
Girl:  Im. Im really sorry. 
Boy:  I swear Ill never be happy again. 
Girl:  We can maybe just be friends. 
Boy:  Maybe can just be friends. You promise me. 
Girl:  I just wanted to know what you felt. 
Boy:  (silence) 
Girl:  And for that, I had to play with your heart. 
Boy:  Why? 
Girl:  Eventually, you would hurt me if I didnt. I really dont want to be hurt anymore. 
Boy:  This is the worst thing you can do to me, to us. 
Girl:  Why do you believe theres still an us? 
Boy:  Because of what you feel for me. Does it mean something? 
Girl:  Maybe a lie. 
Boy:  Wow. 
Girl:  I love you. 
Boy:  Please dont say that. 
Girl:  Its true, I do. 
Boy:  So now you know. 
Girl:  What? 
Boy:  How I feel. 
Girl:  So, what does it feel to be vulnerable? 
Boy:  I feel discovered, unfolded. 
Girl:  Im sorry. You know what you made me feel. 
Boy:  I think. 
Girl:  So? 
Boy:  So? 
Girl:  I have to leave you now. 
Boy:  I still dont get it. 
Girl:  What, my prince? 
Boy:  Why do you want to hurt me? 
Girl:  Mm. 
Boy:  I know I dont deserve this. 
Girl:  I know you dont. 
Boy:  So why? 
Girl:  Because if I dont, you can hurt me again. And Id rather hurt you first, even though I love you. 
Boy:  Is this revenge for you? Are you proud to see me like this? 
Girl:  No, I suffer too, hurting you. 
Boy:  You got me lost. 
Girl:  Oh. 
Boy:  I thought you wanted to hurt me. 
Girl:  I do. Just for you to realize something. 
Boy:  You love me, dont you? 
Girl:  I do. I think I love you a bit too much. 
Boy:  Why is that? 
Girl:  Love is meant to be happy, not sad, and as you make me feel so happy, you make me feel sad sometimes. 
Boy:  Im sorry. I never meant to hurt you. 
Girl:  I know it was not your intention, but somehow you hurt me really deeply. 
Boy:  So what about us? 
Girl:  As for us, Im so in love with you, but I cant do this. I dont want to get hurt again. Youll always be in my heart. I love you. Youre my guardian angel. 
Boy:  I miss you. 
Girl:  And so? 
Boy:  I really did. 
Girl:  OK. 
Boy:  Im sorry. 
Girl:  What for? 
Boy:  For ignoring your efforts to communicate with me. 
Girl:  Its OK. I got used to it, then I got tired, so I stopped trying and started forgetting. 
Boy:  I.tried to forget about you, you see. 
Girl:  . 
Boy:  Because it tore me apart that we can never be. 
Girl:  Its OK. 
Boy:  Why is it so OK? 
Girl:  I got used to days hoping youd be back, but then you never did. I started facing reality and started to move on. 
Boy:  Wait. am I too late? 
Girl:  Too late for what? 
Boy:  To court you? 
Girl:  You know, Ive always wanted to hear that from you. Back then, a year ago. But... I got used to only wishing for it... then realized it would never happen, so I stopped hoping. 
Boy:  Im really sorry, but dont worry, this time, I will make your wishes come true. 
Girl:  Its my turn to say sorry. Time got to me. Youve broken my heart already. I cant risk experiencing that again. Thank you anyway. For communicating with me after a year of silence... 
Girl:  I want to say something. 
Boy:  Yes, darling? 
Girl:  I have a question for you. 
Boy:  Alright, ask me. 
Girl:  What do you see when you look in my eyes? 
Boy:  You honestly want to know? 
Girl:  Yeah! 
Boy:  My future. 
Girl:  I hate the fact that you are taller than me. 
Boy:  Trust me, there is an advantage in it. 
Girl:  What? 
Boy:  When I hug you, you can listen to my heart which beats only for you. 
Boy:  At last, I can hardly wait! 
Girl:  Do you want me to leave? 
Boy:  No, dont even think about it! 
Girl:  Do you love me? 
Boy:  Of course, always! 
Girl:  Have you ever cheated on me? 
Boy:  No, why are you asking? 
Girl:  Will you kiss me? 
Boy:  Every chance I get. 
Girl:  Will you slap me? 
Boy:  Hell no, are you crazy?! 
Girl:  Can I trust you? 
Boy:  Yes! 
Girl:  Darling!! 
Boy:  Oh my God, are you okay? 
Boy:  Sweetie!! Talk to me!!

Boy:  Why didnt you tell me? 
Girl:  I didnt want to hurt you. 
Boy:  You could never hurt me. 
Girl:  I just wanted to see if you felt about me the same as I felt about you. 
Boy:  ? 
Girl:  I love you more than anything. I would give you the world in a heartbeat. I would die for you and take a bullet for you. 
Boy:  (crying) 
Girl:  Dont be sad. I love you and Ill always be here with you.
